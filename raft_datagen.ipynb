    "In this notebook, we'll synthesize some training data that will eventually be used to fine-tune a GPT-4o mini model in order to adapt it to a set of document(s) and specific domain. **This step is critical as the quality of your training data will greatly influence the performance of your fine-tuned model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For RAFT, these are the different steps to prepare the training dataset:\n",
    "- Collect Domain-Specific Documents: Gather documents relevant to the domain you want to specialize the LLM in (e.g., medical documents for PubMed, legal documents, API documentation for software).\n",
    "- Chunk the file into Documents\n",
    "- For each Document chunk, generate a set of Questions that can be answered from the Document\n",
    "- For each Document-Question pair, create a list of documents using:\n",
    "    - **Golden Document (D*)**: Document that contains the answer to the question.\n",
    "    - **Distractor Documents (Dk)**: Documents that do not contain relevant information.\n",
    "- Question-Answer-Document Triplets: From each **Document-Question** pair, generate a factual **Answer** based on the Golden Document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curating a good training dataset often involves manual work and review by SMEs. That said, we can use an LLM to help us generate an initial set of training examples that can be vetted and further refined by SMEs.\n"
