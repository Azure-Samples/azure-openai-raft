Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the relevant section in the context that talks about debit card purchases.\n2. Extract the information about the networks that allow for purchases outside of Canada.\n\nFirst, we find the relevant section:\n\n##begin_quote##\n### Debit card purchases\n\nWhy carry a lot of cash? In Canada, you can pay for purchases at any merchant displaying the **Interac** Direct Payment symbol, and throughout the world, with the Maestro network or any other network we make available.\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this, we see that:\n\n- In Canada, purchases can be made using the Interac Direct Payment symbol.\n- Throughout the world, purchases can be made using the Maestro network or any other network made available by the bank.\n\nSo, the networks that allow for debit card purchases outside of Canada are the Maestro network and potentially other networks made available by the bank.\n\n<ANSWER>: The Maestro network and any other network made available by the bank allow for debit card purchases outside of Canada.
